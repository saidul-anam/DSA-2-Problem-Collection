>a A Civil Engineer is given a task to connect n houses with the main electric power station directly or indirectly. The Govt has given him permission to connect exactly n wires to connect all of them. Each of the wires connects either two houses, or a house and the power station. The costs for connecting each of the wires are given.
Since the Civil Engineer is clever enough and tries to make some profit, he made a plan. His plan is to find the best possible connection scheme and the worst possible connection scheme. Then he will report the average of the costs.
Now you are given the task to check whether the Civil Engineer is evil or not. That's why you want to calculate the average before he reports to the Govt.
